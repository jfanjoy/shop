## Description

This mod adds a sales stand (shop) and banknotes for players to sell and exchange goods.
In addition to the banknotes, the mod also adds a debit card, which can be used to pay
for goods in the shop.
To use the debit card, the player simply has to have it in their inventory. The shop
will automatically detect the card and use it to pay for the goods.
If the debit card is deposited in the register, a transfer instead of cash payment is made.

### Chat Commands

 - Check the balance of the debit card with `/balance`
 - Set the account balance with: `/set_balance <player> <value>` (requires "server" privs)
 - Reset the offer database with: `/reset_offer` (requires "server" privs)

### Central Bank

The role of the Central Bank is to issue banknotes and debit cards.
This can be done by using the shop. The shop can be used to spend money for ores
or other items and to issue debit cards against banknotes.
As a bank the shop can also be used to top up credit cards.
For this the Gold Card has to be placed in the shop's stock.
The owner of the Gold Card has unlimited credit, the card should be used with care or only
used for the Central bank to issue debit cards.
